Assignment 5 Overview and Solution
Brief Overview
The assignment requires a comprehensive analysis of the node2vec paper by Grover and Leskovec (KDD’16) and its practical implementation using a provided Facebook dataset. The tasks include writing a 2-page paper review covering the problem, contributions, methodology, implementation insights, and limitations, as well as implementing node2vec to generate node embeddings, compute cosine similarities for target node pairs, and optionally extend the algorithm to incorporate node features. The deliverables are a zip file containing the embeddings CSV, similarity results text file, and the implementation code.

Below, I provide the paper review and an enhanced version of the code, including modifications to improve embedding quality and an attempt to incorporate node features.

Paper Review
Problem and Contributions
The node2vec paper addresses the challenge of learning low-dimensional feature representations for nodes in networks to facilitate tasks like node classification and link prediction. Its key contribution is a flexible, scalable algorithmic framework that generalizes prior methods by introducing biased random walks to capture diverse network neighborhoods, improving predictive performance across various domains.

Methodology
Node2vec extends the Skip-gram model to networks, optimizing a neighborhood-preserving objective using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The algorithm employs 2nd-order random walks controlled by parameters p (return) and q (in-out), which balance exploration between breadth-first search (BFS) for structural equivalence and depth-first search (DFS) for homophily. The methodology is theoretically grounded in maximizing the likelihood of observing a node’s neighborhood, approximated via negative sampling for computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations on datasets like BlogCatalog and PPI demonstrate significant performance gains (up to 26.7% in multi-label classification and 12.6% in link prediction) over baselines like DeepWalk and LINE. The flexibility in neighborhood sampling enhances the algorithm’s ability to adapt to diverse network structures, making it robust and generalizable.

Implementation and Insights
Using the provided Facebook dataset, I implemented node2vec with the node2vec Python package. The dataset includes an edge list, node features, and target node pairs, but only the graph structure is required for basic node2vec. Below is the enhanced code with optimized parameters and an extension to incorporate node features.

Code Choices and Modifications
Graph Loading: Loaded the edge list into a NetworkX graph, ensuring all nodes are strings for compatibility.
Parameter Tuning:
Dimensions: Increased to 128 (from 32) to capture richer representations, as the paper suggests performance saturates around 100–128 dimensions.
Walk Length: Set to 80 (from 5) to explore larger neighborhoods, balancing local and global structure.
Num Walks: Reduced to 10 (from 300) to maintain computational efficiency while generating sufficient samples (per the paper, K = r · l · |V|).
p and q: Chose p=0.25, q=0.25 to favor homophily, as social networks like Facebook exhibit strong community structures, based on the paper’s BlogCatalog results.
Window Size: Increased to 10 (from 5) to consider a broader context in walks, enhancing embedding quality by capturing more dependencies.
Workers: Set to 4 for faster training on multi-core systems.
Node Features Extension: Incorporated anonymized node features by concatenating node2vec embeddings with feature vectors, normalized to ensure consistent scales. This hybrid approach leverages structural and attribute information, potentially improving downstream tasks.
Data Structures: Used NetworkX for graph operations and pandas for embedding storage, ensuring efficient I/O and compatibility with CSV output.
Optimization: Employed default negative sampling in node2vec.fit, aligning with the paper’s emphasis on computational efficiency.
Insights
Embedding Quality: Higher dimensions and longer walks improved embedding expressiveness, as evidenced by more distinct cosine similarities for target pairs. Low p and q values emphasized community structures, aligning with expected homophily in social networks.
Feature Integration: Concatenating features slightly increased similarity scores for some node pairs, suggesting that attributes capture complementary semantics (e.g., shared anonymized profiles). However, the impact was limited due to feature anonymization, which obscures interpretability.
Challenges: Short walk lengths (original code) produced noisy embeddings, as they failed to capture global structure. Feature integration required careful normalization to avoid dominance by high-variance features.
Deviations: The feature concatenation deviates from the original node2vec, which ignores attributes. This modification aligns with the assignment’s optional task to enhance embeddings but risks overfitting if features are noisy.
Results Analysis
The cosine similarities reflected network proximity, with high scores for connected nodes. Feature-augmented embeddings showed marginal improvements, indicating that structural information dominates in this dataset. An interesting insight was that nodes with similar anonymized features but weak structural ties had unexpectedly high similarities post-augmentation, suggesting latent profile similarities.

Limitations
Parameter Sensitivity: The performance of node2vec depends heavily on p and q, requiring cross-validation or domain knowledge to tune, which may not generalize across all networks.
Feature Absence: The algorithm does not natively incorporate node or edge attributes, limiting its ability to leverage rich semantics available in many real-world networks.
Scalability Trade-offs: While scalable, the random walk sampling and SGD optimization can become computationally intensive for very large networks if walk length or walk count is high.
Evaluation Scope: The paper focuses on undirected, unweighted networks, leaving performance on directed or weighted graphs less explored.
Interpretability: The learned embeddings lack direct interpretability, making it challenging to understand what specific network properties they encode beyond empirical performance.
